You will find on this page specific information for speakers (slides, rooms equipments, setup testing recommandation) and also, the speakers dinner and some not so trustable advices about hotels ;-) <br><br>

**IMPORTANT:** **all other practical information** (conference location, how to come, registration, eat/drink/social event ...) are located on the [general practical info page](/practical/).<br><br>

# Speakers dinner

On Tuesday July 1 evening, we will have a lunch with all the speakers who have accepted to come and the org team.<br><br>
It will be held at :
- Location will be updated during May
- Maps: to come

The dinner will be paid by the event, with a package for the drinks.<br><br>

# Hotels

It is not an easy task to give you a trustable advice for your hotel. All we can do is to share with you the hotels we have used by the past. They all provide nights between 100€ and 140€.<br><br>

No air conditionning, less expensive:<br>
- [Hôtel Chagnot](https://hotel-chagnot-lille.com/)
- [Grand Hotel](https://www.grandhotellille.com/)
- [Ambassadeur Hotel](https://www.hotel-lille-ambassadeur.fr/)

More expensive, with AC:<br>

- [Okko Hotel](https://www.okkohotels.com/en/page/lille/.3097.html)<br>
- [La Valiz Hotel](https://www.hotellavaliz.com/)<br><br>

The best advice we can share is for <b>the location of the hotel</b>: <b>try to stay around the Bruxelles or Flandres stations area</b>. This way you will be near the center of Lille and also near the "Gare Lille Flandres" bus stop where you will take the bus n°5 to reach the conference location.<br><br>

**Important:** other practical information (location, how to come etc) are available on the [dedicated practical info page](/practical/) !<br><br>

# Talks & slides

**Test your video setup BEFORE your talk:** please come during the pause (or before the start of the morning / afternoon session) on stage in order to test your laptop with the video system.
<br><br>

**Duration:** there are long (35min) and short (20min) talks. Each given duration includes the Q&A time. We use to dedicate 5min to Q&A but it remains your choice. If the 5min does not fit you, just give us your preference before the talk and we will announce it to the audience.
<br><br>

**Speaker deck template and format:** Pass the SALT does not provide nor require any kind of template. We prefer to receive PDF files. You can also provide LibreOffice format if you preferred. Powerpoint, anyone? You are at Pass the SALT, please ;-)
<br><br>

**Code of Conduct:** Pass the SALT has a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/) for attendees and for speakers too, obviously. Your words and your slides will have to follow it without exception. Thanks in advance!
<br><br>

**Logo:** you can use our logo on your speaker deck. The correct source for it is in this [repository]( https://github.com/pass-the-salt/2024-communication/tree/main/logo/). 
<br><br>

**IMPORTANT send us your speaker deck:** we will greatly appreciate if you can provide your slides before your talk or just after it. We try to provide them to all attendees (on-site and online ones) as soon as possible on our [archives site](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/Pass%20the%20SALT/).
