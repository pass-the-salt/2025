Due to agenda conflict, we haven't been able to have Pass the SALT hosted by Polytech school as years before.<br><br>

After some research, we are very pleased and honoured to announce that the **2025 edition of Pass the SALT conference will be held** on the beautiful **Université Catholique de Lille** campus in Lille center.

More detailled information will come soon here.

## Safety & COVID information

At time of writing (December 2023), there is no longer mandatory measures for handling COVID outbreak in public and open space or inside buildings aswell. Pass the SALT rooms will so be freely accessible without any mask for example.
<br><br>

**Rooms equipments** :<br>
.&nbsp;**lecture hall**:  there is a ventilation system that is automatically activated when the temperature rises or when the CO2 reaches a certain level. In addition, polytech has several portable CO2 detectors and one will be placed prominently on the desk at the bottom of the lecture hall.
<br>
.&nbsp;**workshop room**: there is air-conditioning, there will also be a portable CO2 detector in place. 

<br>

**Pauses:** they will be held inside the building due to mandatory access control.
<br><br>

**Social event:** we will be have an access to a terrace. So, we will be able to get fresh air and not to stay inside the building during all the evening. -->
